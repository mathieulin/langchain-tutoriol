      "[Document(page_content=\"the iconic character I'm about to create as the in this interview I am better boss Colin these are my iconic characters a good wife I think everyone kind of expected something that was titled The Good Wife to be this kind of schlocky silly soapy kind of thing and then it turned into like seven seasons of like the best network television that we've seen I loved doing that show I've been doing a lot of TV it was maybe one of my first recurring roles one of my first roles that became kind of recurring signed it up doing six episodes of The Good Wife I played like this attorney Nathan Landry who was keeping julianna margulies Alicia Florrick's husband Peter Florrick in jail he was trying to get out on bail this was like mid first season it was his Florrick I have one more question did you meet with a divorce attorney on February 23rd they didn't have sets yet so we shot in a real Queens County Courthouse so they were night shoots because it was a functioning courthouse in Queens during the day so the only time we could shoot the the courthouse scenes in the first season was overnight they actually had consultants courtroom consultants lawyers and stuff on set and they would tell you you wouldn't really stand in this moment it wouldn't be appropriate you wouldn't approach the witness like that and etc so that we were in really good hands that that shows amazing some of my favorite shows I continued watching it long after I was an afterthought the Mentalist there I was like the kind of like sad love interest that was the first time I got to be like let's bring somebody in so that people start freaking out that these two might not end up together and then I made one of my best friends Robin Tunney she was kind of like the film indie queen through the 90s and just so beautiful in such a good actress and and then we became such good friends I loved doing that scene with her she's in a red dress and and and and we're we're having dinner and I'm asking her it seems like on our second date to move to Washington DC with me rezoning I don't want you to go I really don't okay with me I'm asking what if we went to DC you and me together moves fast I move fast we had our own like little theme music just want to say and I know moving to DC is a big thing and it might raise issues you don't feel totally comfortable talking to me about it was amazing Game of Thrones never heard of it there's a little little show called Game of Thrones let me explain it to you for those of you that don't know anyway let's just end that joke there the yeah go burn Oberon Martell man the red Viper what do you want change my life they have the whole season all the episodes are written and you know scheduled based on location for it to shoot like a 10-hour movie at least when it was 10 episodes in the fourth season if so it feels like doing a big movie and and basically you can shoot something in Episode seven and then go back to episode two and then you know and that happened to mean for me my my big acting and dialogue scene with one of the best actors in the world on my very first day of shooting she always gets what she wants and what about what I want justice for my sister and her children do i have to describe what that felt like I was terrified and and and and it was amazing it was just very surreal because I was also stepping on to the set of a show that I was obsessed with and I was seeing you know and and and we had a rehearsal you know the day before and Peter Dinklage I've seen him on stage he's an incredibly generous actor so he just was just like sitting down and doing a scene with a pro over and over and over and over again when you see a helicopter spin jumps about six feet in the air That's not me that would be Lang who is a wushu expert and master and has gone on to do the Jedi fights in the Star Wars movies and but I did learn the fight I did training in in Los Angeles for a couple of weeks before going and shooting and then throughout the whole shoot before getting to the fight there were fight for our souls and fight training and stuff like that it was very very specifically choreographed and if you see my face it is me [Applause] [Music] earlier mark time do you want to know how they did it he had tubing through his arms that would come out from his thumbs so he's he's seven feet 420 pounds when we were shooting he might be big he might you know I think he might he could be heavier now because when we shot he was the third strongest man in the world and now he's the first strongest man in the world so he you know puts his thumbs over my eyes and then they start pumping the fake blood I got teeth made just so that if you got a flash of what my mouth looked like after my teeth got knocked out like they're so meticulous it's unbelievable then there was a cast of my of my head from shoulder you know to top or just a regular cast and also one with like the you know frozen expression of absolute anguish it was really funny because there were just things lost in cross communication in terms of the UK and and and and North America in terms of whether or not I had been cast in the part and as far as HBO was concerned it was official as far as my agents were concerned it wasn't and so I was getting goop poured over my head and they were casting my like like building my head to be crushed and I was just like did I get the part why does this mean I'm doing it you know it's kind of funny not of course that was my first series regular role of which I had been like you know clamoring for for so many years I can't tell you how the whole thing in Colombia even if there were scenes that uh that take place in Texas or Miami or something like that we found with locations all around Colombia or in Panama but all three seasons that I shot we shot in Colombia we we all got started on it together you know we were all part of the the freshmen chapter of season one in Colombia and that meant so many things in terms of creating and inventing the subtle or not so subtle details about the character and this is my partner Javier Pena who figured the best way to get inside narco information was to hang out with the same women they did pretty close I met him before I met even my bosses he was a great guy he's really relaxed easygoing guy um he's not expecting anything from you he's not putting any kind of pressure on you he doesn't want to insist on telling you like I'm giving you insights he's just like hey what's up you know I like Coors Light what do you like and and it was funny too because I I was apprehensive about the training and I found it intimidating and I just was really nervous about the whole thing and Boyd was like we're gonna go we're going to Quantico we're gonna do this and I was like do we have to tell your opinion you know he was like when we were at Quantico he's like just bringing up some intense memories I was like what you mean he's like hmm just you know it's intense it's like okay I'm with you men you know I feel like there is a loner aspect to him that I could I could really connect to because it takes place in the 80s and all that 80's clothes just looks like I look like I was playing dress-up I look like a kid I look like a child like I just got lost in it and I looked like a dork and so I came up with this idea I was like you know let's just say Javier Pena is like Don Draper in that like the 70s is his like that was where he really found himself and he can't really and so he's stuck there he's not throwing those pants out he's not changing his hair he's not changing his shoes it's his time and he's gonna look like that until the day he dies that was my justification Kingsman V Golden Circle to be in in moves of this size and to in Matthew Vaughn he is such a Natur and and and in specific filmmaker because he's so specific and uncompromising about his aesthetic and what he wants it to how he wants it and everything he's also a really fun guy to be around and and that was about you know him teaching me that I could actually do these things and play this kind of a character and do that kind of action and pull it off it was not anything that I could imagine even after having done Game of Thrones there was so much character and emotional history with with a character like Oberon and with whisky it was just like flash you know what I mean and to sit at a table with Colin Firth and Jeff Bridges and Halle Berry and Julianne Moore's over there and Channing Tatum's over here you know what I mean it just I just like had to stop myself from asking for autographs there is this incredible lassu whip and gun-slinging expert he's the one who trained me and did the jumping through the so that he when you see the jumping through the the lasso loop that is new Rollins is his name and he is actually doing that he is doing all of that he's boundless in his capacity to to manipulate a whip a lasso and and guns equalizer to remember my agents were like they want to know if you'd be willing to audition and I was like willing to audition to be in a movie with Denzel Washington directed by Antoine Fuqua you know crack absolutely not offer only I auditioned to my ass off for them it's like what do you want me to do you know and tons of Washington is my movie star you know what I mean and not yours nobody else is mine I just wanted to sit next to him which I got to do and more obviously [Music] that's right I had to tell them was like you know this was referencing something specific and they're like what and I was like don't worry about it she wasn't you to be a part of an ensemble cast with a bunch of dudes that are such good actors and to work with frankly one of my best friends with whom I did my first play in New York with 14 years ago and and and we were doing this like really intricate car chase scene and he's in the back of the pickup and I'm in the driver's seat I hear his voice behind my head and he's like here we are in an action movie together in Hawaii and I was like was so crazy you know it's just so so funny I would have never have been able to like compose that for my future it's so weird catfish that's why playing he's I I I'm the pilot and the driver I feel like I always get behind the wheel or in the cockpit and and somehow that told me the most about my character fish I need a pilot I got the baby now this can change you in that baby's life forever where he kind of sits back he's a little bit more in the shadows he doesn't have a lot to say and then when it's decision time you know he steps up prospect they're very visionary young directors those two Zeke Earl and Chris Caldwell that was a really really tough shoot and it was worth it because of what they capture visually yeah it was it was miserable I can't I tell you this was not a big-budget film and and and I mean we were all just you know we couldn't breathe a huge challenge that was worth it to them to the visual experience of the movie and and be in those spacesuits man lay you from nowhere oh boy the Queen's lair I'm ready to like do something where like I'm sitting you know my character doesn't really get up from a chair or have anything to wear just just just just just listen\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'EUTGtoIzkdk', 'title': 'Pedro Pascal
